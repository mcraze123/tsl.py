<h2>Missing Characters</h2>
<div align=right>25 Nov 2010</div><p>

There have been a couple of reports of missing digits in the data
stream from the microcontroller to the host.<p>

I have a theory.  The PIC 12C509 is meant to be programmed in a
specific way by the seller.  The code space contains a preprogrammed
calibration constant for the internal R/C oscillator.  The
instructions that I provided to the original seller Kitsrus
specifically excluded the memory address for the calibration constant,
so that the constant set in chip manufacturing process would be left
intact.<p>

However, if someone has later attempted to duplicate the code from one
PIC 12C509 to another, this might result in an incorrect calibration
constant for the oscillator.  It is impractical to correct, since the
PIC 12C509 with plastic top is a one-time-programmed part.<p>

As a result, the asynchronous serial data would not exactly match the
baud rate expected by the serial port.  Characters would be
dropped.<p>

If you were to analyse the electrical signal on the serial port, and
compare the timing against the baud rate, you may find that is the
cause of the problem.<p>

Of course, the timing source in your serial port, or USB to serial
converter might also be a source of the symptom!<p>

<hr noshade>
<h2>Assembling on Recent Versions of GPASM</h2>
<div align=right>02 Nov 2009</div><p>

gpasm has changed since this project began, and rather than obtain an
old version, you can use a current version of gpasm.  You need certain
flags:<p>

<pre>
gpasm --ignore-case \
      --processor 12C509 \
      --warning 1 \
      ds1820.asm
</pre>

That said, I've not tested that it works on chip!

<hr noshade>
<h2>Using a USB to Serial Adaptor</h2>
<div align=right>17 May 2009</div><p>

George asked <i>I already own a temperature kit (it works perfect in
my serial port) and I would like to know if it is compatible with USB
to Serial adapters?</i><p>

Perhaps.  The original design was not compatible with all serial ports,
and so it is entirely possible that it might not be compatible with some
USB to serial adapters.<p>

If you're able to see into the adaptor and detect a small integrated
circuit of about 16 pins that is labelled MAX232 with about four
capacitors around it, then it is likely to work.  The MAX232 or
equivalent raise the operating voltage to meet the standard.<p>

If you are able to test the adapter first by measuring the voltage of a
signal line like DTR with respect to the GND pin, (this will be non-zero
just by plugging it in to a USB port, no application should need to be
run), ... if you get around 5V, then it probably won't power the
temperature kit well ... but if you get around 12V it should work fine.<p>

You can also modify the temperature sensor kit for an external 12V DC
supply, by disconnecting the DTR trace from the connector to the
diode, and connecting 12V DC there.  Instead of powering the
microcontroller and sensors from the DTR signal, it will be powered
from your external source.<p>

You can also modify the temperature sensor kit to use the USB supply
voltage, by connecting the 5V line from the USB cable (the computer side
of the USB to serial adaptor) to the 5V *output* of the voltage
regulator.<p>

<h2>Report GNU GPL License Violations</h2>
<div align=right>30 April 2007</div><p>

As the copyright owner of ds1820.asm below, which is licensed under
the GNU General Public License, I would like to hear from anyone who
has purchased a microcontroller which contains a work derived from
this, and who has not been able to obtain the source code of the
version on the chip.<p>

The information I would like you to include:<p>
<ol>
<li>who you are, including your postal address,
<li>who you purchased it from, and when,
<li>what price you paid,
<li>whether the included documentation referred you to me or my web site,
<li>how you tried to obtain the source from the seller,
<li>what the seller's response was,
<li>on what basis you believe it is derived from my work.
</ol>

In addition, if you have obtained the source code, and it is clearly
derived from my work, I'd like to receive a copy of it so that I can
improve the project.  Please let me know how I can receive a copy.<p>

<h2><a name=schematic>Circuit Schematic</a></h2>

<img src=schematic.jpg width=956 height=572>

<hr noshade>
<h2><a name=operation>Theory of Operation</a></h2>

The program in the microcontroller knows two protocols; the one wire
bus used by the DS1820 temperature sensor, and the serial protocol
expected by your computer.  Once power is applied, the program fetches
data from the sensors and sends it to the serial port, repeatedly.<p>

The data from the DS1820 arrives in a format peculiar to the sensor.
The program calculates the temperature from the data and translates it
into human readable ASCII digits.  No special program is required on
the computer.<p>

<hr noshade>
<h2><a name=usage>Usage Instructions</a></h2>

Plug the circuit into the serial port of a computer.  Persuade the
computer to expect serial data at 2400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, one or
two stop bits.  Ask the computer to raise the DTR signal.  (See below
for software that will do this for you.)  The microcontroller will
start talking to the connected DS1820 sensors and the circuit should
begin transmitting data to the computer.  For example:<p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
     R V1.0 1999-12-21 22:05:03 C
     1 0022.50
     2 0022.47
     3 0022.52
     4 0022.53
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The first line sent by the microcontroller is a reset notification,
which includes the microcode version, a date and time serial number,
and either a C or an F, depending on the GP3 pin at the time.  <p>

The sensor data is reported in the international standard Centigrade
if the GP3 pin is tied low.  If it is tied high, then the data is
converted to Fahrenheit.  A larger range and accuracy is obtained from
running in Centigrade mode; users are advised to make their
conversions within the attached computer.  <p>

<p>

Other hints for operation:
<ul>

<li><i>(if you have one of the special versions)</i> to use an input
pin as a simple digital input, connect it to the supply pin (pin 1)
via a resistor of about 10k, and connect a switch between the pin and
the ground pin (pin 8) through a resistor of about 1k.  When the
switch is closed a zero will be read.  Avoid shorting the pin directly
to the supply, as the microcontroller may attempt to pull it low
during the test for a DS1820 sensor.<p>

<li>a 10uF tantalum capacitor across the power supply pins of the
DS1820 chips tends to provide more consistent measurements.  To put
it another way, if you remove it you may get random error in the
samples.<p>

</ul>

<hr noshade>
<h2><a name=design>Design Discussion</a></h2>

Some people will have a number of comments about my design.  Please
remember I'm an amateur electronics enthusiast and a professional
software engineer.<p>

Why not operate the DS1820 sensors on a bus instead of per port?
There is insufficient memory within the microcontroller to remember
the device address for more than one or two sensors.  It is simple to
remember which pin is being addressed.<p>

This circuit may not work with some serial ports.  One reason is that
the voltage swing of the transmit data to the computer is not within
specification, however the detection band for most serial ports
accepts it.<p>

No protection is present for lightning damage.  Adding this protection
is beyond my skill.  Users should disconnect the device before
experiencing lightning if the cabling is of significant length.<p>

The 78L05 regulator may not be able to regulate properly if the
current and voltage provided by the serial port DTR pin is
insufficient.  Ideally this should be a more expensive low drop
regulator, or a zener diode instead.  Symptoms of insufficient voltage
are loss of the start of the verbose reset packet.<p>

The 1N4003 diode could be replaced with a diode having a lower voltage
drop.<p>

In fact, the DTR line could be just connected to the 12V supply rail
within the computer itself in order to get around most of the power
problems.<p>

Why isn't there a MAX232 or other chip to change the signal levels
from 0V to +15V and 5V to -15V as required by the EIA232 standard used
by computer serial ports?  Almost all serial ports are offset such
that voltages above 4V are recognised as being logic 0, and voltages
below 1V as logic 1.  This allows external devices the ability to
violate the standard by sending an inverted 0V/5V signal.<p>

This means the device is not suitable for long cable runs, and may not
work with all serial ports.  However the author has tested the device
on more than 30 ports with no issues.<p>

    port and run gtsl.<p>

  </ul>

  <li>Serial Temperature Sensor 1.0,<p>

  For programming your own PIC 12C509 microcontroller.<p>

  Drives the DS1820 sensors, obtains temperature readings, converts

<h2><a name=license>License</a></h2>

The source code for the microcontroller program was released on 1st
January 2002 under the GNU General Public License.  You have the right
to manufacture and sell duplicates, though under the license terms you
<i>must</i> supply the source code.<p>

I'm happy for you to provide a link to this web page as your way of
supplying the source code.  Something like this:<p>

<center>
<table width=50% cellpadding=4 cellspacing=1 bgcolor=#000000>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>

(Before the release, by purchasing the pre-programmed chip, you had
purchased the right to use the software on the chip.  You had not
purchased any right to manufacture duplicates.  The chips were
programmed with the Code Protect bits set.)<p>

Unlike most of my other work here, this project wasn't originally Open
Source.  It was too exotic for that.<p>

I had wanted to see if I can make anything out of this type of work.
I asked people to buy the chips.  Nobody bought one off me directly,
but I did end up selling a few hundred to Kitsrus.  My return on
investment was negligible.  I don't consider it worth the effort to
continue the project.<p>

<hr noshade>
<h2><a name=faq>Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

<ol>
<li><i>It doesn't work on some serial ports, what to do?</i><p>

Measure the voltage on the supply pins for the microcontroller or the
sensor.  If it is below 4.75V, then the serial port is not supplying
enough current.  Options are either (a) change the serial port, (b)
hook DTR and another signal line together to increase the current, (c)
substitute another power source for DTR, such as from a 12V plug pack,
of at least 20mA capacity, (d) use a low-dropout voltage regulator
instead of the 78L05.<p>

<li><i>It doesn't work on the DS18B20?</i><p>

True.  The code works well for DS1820 sensors.  It works acceptably
for DS18S20 sensors, with a slight degradation in reading accuracy.
It doesn't work properly with the DS18B20.<p>

The reason it doesn't work is that the data is in a different format
inside the sensor.  The bits are used for different purposes.  I do
have several DS18B20, but have not found the time to work on the
problem.  I'd also welcome code changes made by others, under the
GPL.<p>

<li><i>Where is the HEX file?</i><p>

This isn't provided here.  Either buy a preprogrammed chip from <a
href=#availability>others</a> (which I no longer make any money on),
or assemble the code yourself from source.<p>

I don't provide the HEX file to people if they send me mail, either,
because:<p>

<ul>
<li>I've said it isn't provided by me, and I should be consistent,
<li>preprogrammed chips are available from others, and I have no wish
to eat into their business,
<li>the source is provided here, along with patches to ease assembly
on other assembler programs,
<li>the source license does not require that I provide the hex file,
<li>chip programming software and programming hardware change, and so
my hex file may not be compatible with your environment,
<li>assembling from source is not difficult, and there are mailing
lists (such as gnupic or the piclist) where you can go for help,
<li>wanting to learn about microcontrollers and electronics by
constructing this project, and yet being unwilling to do the whole
job, is inconsistent.

The PCB was by Peter.  I agree, there is no obvious method.

This is incorrect.  The line separator used is a CR followed by LF, that
is, 0x0A followed by 0x0D.  See the function tx_crlf in the ds1820.asm
source file.  This is on line 512.  See the references to the function
elsewhere; after the welcome message and after each sensor reading.

If the customer is seeing only the LF character, there may have been a
framing error; where the baud rate of the transmitter does not match the
receiver.  The CR may have been dropped due to the error.

The most likely causes of a framing error are;

a) incorrect transmitter speed,
   a.1) incorrect operating voltage, caused by weak serial port,
   a.2) an overwritten OSCCAL value in PROM, caused by bad programming,
b) incorrect receiver speed,
   b.1) faulty receiver clock,
   b.2) incorrect receiver clock configuration,

Suggested procedure;

1.  optionally confirm that framing errors are occurring, using an
operating system or application that counts or reports the framing
errors,

2.  check that the voltage across the power supply pins of the PIC
12C509 is between 4.75 and 5.25V DC, and if it is outside that range
then correct it,

3.  check that the bit stream from the PIC 12C509 is being emitted at
2400 baud, plus or minus 5%,

4.  read back the PROM from the PIC 12C509 using a PIC programmer, and
examine the OSCCAL value for corruption,

5.  [Kitsrus, Quasar] check that the programming of the PIC 12C509 is
done from the original HEX file, and *not* from a HEX file read from
another 12C509, as this would corrupt the OSCCAL value,

If the OSCCAL value is corrupted, this can lead to the PIC RC oscillator
running at something other than the calibrated frequency.  The OSCCAL
value is set during factory calibration by Microchip, but can be
overwritten by programming.
